        1. Security
Pointers allow <b>direct access to memory</b>
This can lead to:
Data corruption
Hacking
Unauthorized access
Java avoids pointers to protect memory
<br>
<br>
2. Avoids memory errors
Pointers can cause:
Dangling pointers
Memory leaks
Segmentation faults
Java removes pointers to make programs:
More reliable
Less error-prone
<br>
<br>
3. Automatic memory management
Java uses Garbage Collector
Programmer does not free memory manually
No need for pointers like malloc() or free()
<br>
<br>
4. Simplicity
Pointers make code complex
Java is designed to be easy for beginners
<br>
<br>
5. Java uses references instead
Student s = new Student();
s is a reference, not a pointer
You cannot do pointer arithmetic
Safe and controlled
